** Data Binding **

Data binding is a core concept in Angular which allows us to bind data 
from component.ts to .html and send data from .html to .ts.

There are mainly two ways of Data Binding

--One Way Data Binding

1.From component to DOM
   -Interpolation
   -Property binding
   
2.From the DOM to the Component: Event binding
   - (event)=”function”

--Two Way Data Binding

   -[(ngModel)]=”value”

Structural Directives: Directives that change the DOM structure by adding or removing elements.
